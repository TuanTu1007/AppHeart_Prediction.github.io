# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This is a **machine learning-based web application** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user input of medical parameters. The project integrates **Python**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Tkinter** for a seamless user experience in heart risk assessment.

> 🧪 Developed as a final project for the **AI Application Development** course at UIT - VNUHCM (2024).

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using ML models
- 📊 User inputs medical info (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.)
- 📈 Returns risk result with confidence
- 🧪 Uses multiple trained models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, etc.)
- 🌐 Easy-to-use interface 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer         | Tools/Technologies                         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Machine Learning | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy       |
| Front-end     | Tkinter                   |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA phase)            |

## 🧠 ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

> Logistic Regression was selected for final deployment due to its high accuracy and stability in tests.
